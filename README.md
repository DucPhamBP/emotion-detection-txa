# Social Media Sentiment Analysis & Emotion Detection on Remote Working
This repository contains code/report prepared for the "Text Analytics" course at University of Pisa.

### Project Goal
The goal of this project is to build an emotion detection system that can accurately detect and classify emotions from text scraped from social media discussions related to remote working. We will analyze posts from platforms like X (previously known as Twitter) and Reddit to identify their sentiments (positive/negative/neutral) and categorize a range of emotions, including:
- Happiness: Feelings of joy and contentment regarding work-life balance and flexibility.
- Loneliness: Sentiments reflecting social isolation or disconnection from colleagues.
- Sadness: Feelings of loss associated with in-person interactions and office environments.
- Etc.
