      "i dont know how i did it even for a few years i started working from home at least 3 days a week in 2019 went full time wfh in 2020 when back to the office 4 days a week briefly in 2021 before changing jobs to wfh permanently when working in office from 20162019 i definitely gained about 45lbs and felt miserable and work became my entire life personality i didnt have time or energy to date have hobbies or travel i was also making about half as much money as i am now so in hindsight it wasnt even worth all that trouble i cant believe i not only put up with that but also thought i was lucky just to have an office job     sadness\n",
